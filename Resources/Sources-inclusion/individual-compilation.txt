CREATING INDIVIDUAL OBJECT FILES

COMMAND-LINE option = '-c'
 < is used to compile a source file to an object file.

! gcc -Wall -c main.c
This produces an object file 'main.o' containing the machine code for the main
 function. It contains a reference to the external function hello, but the
 corresponding memory address is left undefined in the object file at this
 stage (it will be filled in later by linking).

The corresponding command for compiling the hello function in the source file
 'hello_fn.c' is:

! gcc -Wall -c hello_fn.c

\ /


CREATING EXECUTABLES from OBJECT FILES
The final step in creating an executable file is to use gcc to link the object
 files together and fill in the missing addresses of external functions. To
 link object files together, they are simply listed on the command line:
! gcc main.o hello_fn.o -o hello
