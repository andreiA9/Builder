gcc -Wall main.c hello_fn.c -o newhello

In this case, we use the -o option to specify a different
output file for the executable, 'newhello'. Note that the
 header file 'hello.h' is not specified in the list of
 files on the command line. The directive #include "hello.h"
 in the source files instructs the compiler to include it
 automatically at the appropriate points.
